# üîß Troubleshooting Guide - Sign In Button Issues

## Issue: Sign In Button Not Showing on Landing Page Refresh

### ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Recent Updates

We've resolved the issue where the "Sign In" button would not appear consistently when refreshing the landing page. Here's what was fixed:

### üîç Problem Analysis

1. **Loading State Issue**: During page refresh, there was a brief moment when the authentication state was loading, causing the Header component to not render the Sign In button properly.

2. **Mobile Navigation Missing**: The mobile version of the header was only showing "Join Waitlist" but missing the "Sign In" link.

### üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Added Loading State Handling
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
{user ? (
  <Dashboard />
) : (
  <SignIn />
)}

// After (fixed)
{loading ? (
  <LoadingPlaceholder />
) : user ? (
  <Dashboard />
) : (
  <SignIn />
)}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Mobile Navigation
- Added "Sign In" link to mobile menu
- Improved responsive layout with proper spacing
- Added loading placeholders for smooth transitions

### üéØ Verification Steps

After the fix, verify the following:

1. **Desktop View**:
   - [ ] "Sign In" button appears on page load
   - [ ] "Sign In" button appears after refresh
   - [ ] Loading state shows briefly during auth check
   - [ ] Button switches to "Dashboard" when logged in

2. **Mobile View**:
   - [ ] Both "Sign In" and "Join Waitlist" buttons appear
   - [ ] Proper spacing between buttons
   - [ ] Responsive layout works correctly

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - [ ] Clicking "Sign In" navigates to login page
   - [ ] After login, header shows "Dashboard" button
   - [ ] After logout, header shows "Sign In" again

### üö® If Issue Persists

If you're still experiencing issues, check these common causes:

#### 1. Environment Variables Not Set
```bash
# Check if .env.local exists with correct values
cat .env.local

# Should contain:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

#### 2. Supabase Configuration Issues
- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check that the URL and keys are correct
- Ensure RLS policies are set up properly

#### 3. Browser Cache Issues
```bash
# Clear browser cache and try again
# Or use incognito/private browsing mode
```

#### 4. Console Errors
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check for:
- Network errors to Supabase
- JavaScript errors in Console
- Authentication errors

### üîß Manual Testing

To test the fix manually:

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Visit `/` (landing page)
   - Refresh the page multiple times
   - Check both desktop and mobile views
   - Test login/logout flow

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - "Sign In" button should always appear for unauthenticated users
   - Brief loading state during auth check is normal
   - No flashing or disappearing buttons

### üì± Mobile-Specific Testing

1. Open browser DevTools
2. Toggle device emulation (mobile view)
3. Verify both "Sign In" and "Join Waitlist" appear
4. Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes

### üéâ Summary

The sign-in button visibility issue has been resolved by:
- Adding proper loading state management
- Implementing loading placeholders
- Enhancing mobile navigation
- Ensuring consistent behavior across all device sizes

If you continue to experience issues after these fixes, please check your environment configuration and browser console for additional error messages.
