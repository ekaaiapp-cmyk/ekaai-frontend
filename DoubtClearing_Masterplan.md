## **Text-Based Instant Doubt Clearing feature for the EkaAI MVP\!**

## **Overview & Objective üöÄ**

The primary objective of the Text-Based Instant Doubt Clearing feature is to provide students with immediate, AI-generated explanations for their academic questions. This aims to overcome the hesitation students often feel in asking questions in a traditional classroom setting and to offer on-demand support during self-study. It will be a key component in fostering a confident and independent learning experience.

## **Audience Snapshot üßë‚Äçüéì**

The initial target audience for this feature is **high school and college students** focusing on subjects like **Math & Science**. These students often encounter specific conceptual hurdles that require quick clarification to prevent them from falling behind. They are comfortable with chat interfaces and expect immediate, clear responses.

## **Essential Sections & Content Outline üìù**

This feature will primarily be integrated into the existing **Core Learning Module** and accessible via a **simple chat interface**.

1. **Chat Interface:**  
   * **Input Field:** Where students type their questions.  
   * **Send Button:** To submit the question to the AI.  
   * **Chat History/Bubble Display:** To show the student's question and the AI's response in a conversational format.  
2. **AI Response Display:**  
   * **Clear, Concise Explanation:** The core AI-generated answer.  
   * **Follow-up Prompts (Optional/Future):** Suggestions for related questions or next steps (e.g., "Would you like an example?", "Can I explain this in simpler terms?").

## **Wireframe-Level Layout Description üìê**

Considering our existing tech stack, this feature will be seamlessly integrated within the student dashboard or a specific learning session.

* **Overall Layout:** The doubt-clearing interface will likely be a dedicated section or a modal overlay within the learning environment.  
* **Top Bar (Optional):** Could display the current topic or a "Back to Learning" button.  
* **Chat Area:** This will take up the majority of the screen, displaying the conversation history. It will resemble a typical messaging app, with student messages on one side and AI responses on the other.  
* **Bottom Input Bar:** A persistent input field at the bottom of the chat area, with an associated "Send" button.  
  * **Technology Considerations:** This will primarily leverage **React components** for the UI, with **Tailwind CSS** for layout and styling. The communication with the AI explanation service will happen through our existing **API service layer** (`waitlistAPI.ts` provides a good example of this structure, though a new service file would be created for this feature). The "chat bubbles" and input field will be standard HTML elements styled with Tailwind.

## **Color & Typography Guidelines üé®**

We'll adhere strictly to the established design system from the EkaAI Frontend.

* **Background**: `#1A1A1A` (primary-bg)  
* **Accent**: `#FFD700` (primary-accent) \- Could be used for chat bubbles or interactive elements.  
* **Text**: `#F5F5F5` (primary-text) \- For general text within the chat.  
* **Bright Text**: `#FFFFFF` (primary-text-bright) \- For prominent text like headers or student's own messages.  
* **Headlines**: Poppins (font-headline) \- For any section titles within the interface.  
* **Body Text**: Inter (font-body) \- For the chat messages themselves and input field text.

## **Image / Asset Checklist ‚úÖ**

For the MVP, visual assets will be minimal to keep the focus on functionality.

* **EkaAI Logo:** For branding within the interface.  
* **Send Icon:** For the chat input button.  
* **Loading/Typing Indicator Icon (Optional):** A simple animation to indicate when the AI is generating a response.

## **Possible Future Enhancements ‚ú®**

* **Voice-Enabled Input/Output:** Allowing students to speak their questions and receive spoken answers.  
* **Image/Formula Input:** Ability to upload images of problems or hand-written notes for explanation.  
* **Contextual Follow-Up:** AI proactively suggesting next steps or related concepts based on the explanation.  
* **Multi-Modal Explanations:** Beyond text, incorporating diagrams, short videos, or interactive simulations.  
* **Save/Bookmark Explanations:** Allowing students to save particularly helpful explanations for later review.
